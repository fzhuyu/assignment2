Branches are used in Git repositories because 1. it allows the programmers to work on 
different ideas, bug fix, implement features without interfering with each other. 2. On
the same idea, it also allows the programmer to publish a stable version while working 
on a newer version.

--------------------------------5------------------------------

Git log shows the comits made, whereas Git status shows the current working directory and
staging area, it will not show any information about the project history (commits)

Inheritance is when a child class has all the properties from the parent class, and then
is allowed to add new functions while also using the parent's functions. Inheritance has
a "IS-A" relationship from child to parent. 

The word polymorphism means many forms. This means that a parent class can have many forms.
This parent class can have several children classes that can use the same functions from the
parent class in different ways. Such as: a parent class "animal" can have the forms of "cat",
"dog", "platypus", and they all can use the "animalSound()" from the parent class in their
own way.

Encapsulation refers to data hiding through classes and functions. The purpose of encapsulation 
is to prevent the user from accessing information unless given the tools to (functions).
Encapsulation will hide the information by setting the data in private. Then, allow the user
to access this information with getter functions and change this data with setter functions.

The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow is when the Lieutenants work on different parts of the
repository. The dicator will then merge the lieutenant's branch with their own branch and
then push it to the repository. The Lieutenants will then rebase from the repository.

The Integration manager workflow is when the maintainer pushes their public repository so
that contributors can clone it and work on it. The contributor will then push their cloned copy.
The maintainer can then merge the cloned copy with the main repository and then push the repository.

The main difference is that in the Dicator and Lieutenants workflow, the Lieutenants work on
different branches of the same repository, while the Dictator merge the branches. Whereas in the 
Integration manager workflow, each contributor have their own copy of the repository and work
on different parts at different paces, if a contribution is stable, then the manager merges
their work and pushes it publicly.

--------------------------------10------------------------------

The Dictator and Lieutenant workflow will be more beneficial to 100 developers working at the
same time because it allows them to work on different branches and allow only the Dictator to
push to the main repository. This avoids the conflicts that the Centralized workflow would have
where if many developers want to push, only one will be allowed and the rest must fetch and merge
before pushing to the repository.
